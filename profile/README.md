# Welcome to TindETS ❤️

**TindETS** is a fun and ambitious idea inspired by a post that dared ETS students to create a dating app for **ÉTS (École de technologie supérieure)**. We thought, *Why not dream big?* And so, this GitHub organization was born.

## 🚀 What is TindETS?

At its core, TindETS is imagined as a dating app tailored for ETS students, offering them a way to connect for friendships, relationships, or even casual meetups. But here's the catch: **this project is still in its brainstorming phase**. 

We don’t yet know if this idea will take off or even if it will have the backing of the school. Right now, it’s all about dreaming, discussing, and exploring the possibilities.

If you’re curious about what could come of this, join the conversation in our **[Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/TindETS/discussions)** tab.

## 🌱 Current Status

We’re still in the **idea and brainstorming phase**:
- No active development yet.
