# Welcome to TindETS ❤️

**TindETS** is a student-driven project born from a moment of pure whimsy—and a little dare. One day, a post appeared asking computer science students to create a dating app for **ÉTS (École de technologie supérieure)**. We thought, *Why not?* And here we are!

Our mission is to connect ETS students looking for meaningful (or not-so-meaningful) connections—whether it’s friendship, a serious relationship, casual dates, or even just one night of shared stars.

## 🚀 What is TindETS?

TindETS is designed specifically for **ETS students**, but if things go well, we might just expand our matchmaking magic to other schools. After all, love and connection should know no boundaries (even if we do 👀).

Here’s what we’re building:
- **Swiping**: Because first impressions matter!
- **Matching**: When two hearts (or interests) align.
- **Chat Functionality**: Keep the conversation going with temporary chat options.
- **No Filters**: No distractions, just genuine connections.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Our tech stack is simple, robust, and focused on scalability:
- **MariaDB**: To manage all those matches.
- **Python Flask**: The brains behind our API.
- **React Native**: Ensuring our app feels at home on any smartphone.
- **Docker**: Streamlining development, deployment, and scalability by containerizing our app.

## 🤓 The Origin Story

One fateful day, someone joked, *“Computer science students should create a dating app for ETS.”* Most laughed it off, but a few brave souls said, *“Challenge accepted.”* Thus, TindETS was born—a testament to what happens when nerds mix humor, coding, and (possibly) a sprinkle of romance. 

Stay tuned, because this story is just getting started.
